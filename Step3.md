# Step 3: Collaborate with colleagues 

Find out how to engage your colleagues in the discussion and work out who to get involved.

We work better together, whether in a team, department, organization, or across organizations. Consider your context and determine the initial level of your collaboration:

- [ ] Colleague/s
- [ ] Your immediate team
- [ ] Wider team / department
- [ ] A bigger part of the organisation
- [ ] Whole organisation


**Review**

Can you build on existing initiatives within your organisation and the sector?

- [ ] Internal policies, processes or strategies
- [ ] Internal working groups or communities of practice
- [ ] External policies or strategies
- [ ] External, cross-institutional communities of practice,
- [ ] special interest groups
