Global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels means that we are facing more
frequent and more intense extreme weather events that are causing increasingly dangerous
impacts on nature and people in every region of the world. Change is required at all levels of
society urgently to ensure a liveable and sustainable future for all.

**What impact do the use of digital learning tools and practices have on the
environment?**

**How can we embed sustainability into our roles and the processes, policies and work
of digital education?**

A small cross institutional group of individuals concerned about the role of digital education
in the climate crisis developed and ran a series of workshops on Digital Education ​and ​the
climate and ecological emergency​. We wanted others to be able to run the workshop within
their own place of work and to share the outputs, initiatives, resources and guidance with the
wider community. We then developed this toolkit as a step by step plan for individuals to
have climate conversations at work and to encourage reflection on how to influence
structural change within and between institutions.

**What can I do? How to turn concern into meaningful action**

Based on the work done by Nature’s workforce, this toolkit is designed to help guide you
through the process of steps for climate and nature positive actions within your own digital
education contexts.

“Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve
deep and sustained emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for
all.”  (IPCC The Synthesis Report of the Sixth Assessment Report (2023).

> “Businesses are in a unique position to help solve the nature crisis because many have
influence through their value or supply chains. They can move faster than any government in
tackling a problem and they have access to some of the best minds, funding and
technology.”
