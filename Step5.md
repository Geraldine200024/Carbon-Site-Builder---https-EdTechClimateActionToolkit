# Step 5: Take action 

**You’ve started the conversation and now you need to build your idea and work out a plan to start putting it into effect.
**
Use the output of the workshop to inspire colleagues and develop an action plan. Remember to share your ideas and collaborate with those outside your organisation who are also doing work in this area.

We have included a checklist taken from ClimateVoice.org to give you some ideas and get you started.

##**Checklist**

- [ ] **Review your workshop output**

Go though the collaborative document and polling data, remember to share it with us. See if there is anything that stands out as an area that people would like to work on.

- [ ] **Write a proposal.**

Create summary material for decision makers and fellow employees.

- [ ] **Draft an advocacy letter.** 

It can be from a small group of committed employees or you can begin gathering signatures to show mass support.

- [ ] **Make the pitch.**

Set up a meeting with the executive decision-maker or influencer.

- [ ] **Set goals and create a timeline**

See our example below. You may want to factor in raising awareness and involving staff and students.

- [ ] **Get clear on next steps.**

Change takes time - build on each action one step at a time.

- [ ] **Send a follow-up.**

Recap the discussion and action items, share gratitude for the opportunity to come to the table.

- [ ] **Debrief with your community**

Discuss what worked, what didn’t work, and what was missed. Identify best practices and additional steps to take. (ALT SIG or collaborative doc).

- [ ] **Act on your next step sooner than later**

Keep the momentum, and don’t be disparaged if you hit a roadblock. If your target feels out of reach, focus on achieving small wins until you can regroup on the larger issues. Check in with the wider community for support and advice if you get stuck.
